# Raspberry Portable
The Raspberry Portable is a cheap portable DIY project seeking to mimic a Gameboy color using a Raspberry PI and this repository contains all the files needed to build it yourself.

(we are not responsible if you choose to pirate roms to use on this device)

To create this you will need 

A Raspberry Pi 3 or 4

A decent computer with a micro SD card reader (you can buy an adapter online)

A 3D printer (only if you want the custom shell)
